    <h1>Stephen Wilson</h1>
    <p>
        I am a Junior at MIT pursuing a B.S. in Artificial Intelligence and Decision Making. I have a strong interest in AI and a passion for developing AI and machine learning to integrate it into end-to-end production software that will have a positive impact on society.

        Recently, I worked at Google on the Android Performance Testing team using machine learning to optimize tests by predicting if performance regression detection parameters are properly set for a metric.
