                STEP Intern, ML-based noise detection for the Android Platform Performance EngProd team - Mountain View, CA</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Machine Learning-based noise detection solution using derived statistical features.</li>
                <li>The project has the potential to save ~1400 device-hours per month, a 2.8% resource usage improvement.</li>
                <li>Composed an in-depth, 13-page software design that also compared 16 different models.</li>
                <li>Built an End-to-End ML system with Python and SQL to predict if performance regression detection
                    parameters are properly set for a metric.
                    </li>
                <li>Trained multiple classification models with an internal AutoML framework using TensorFlow - including
                    Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Neural Network models - and employed different training strategies.
                    </li>
                <li>Invented two original algorithms that validate and refine model output, eliminating 60% of noisy predictions.</li>
                <li>Executed the full MLOps practice, from scoping to model deployment, in iterations.</li>
                <li>Collaborated with another intern, who integrated the input and output of the ML system into the existing infra.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Investigated the features crucial for cryptocurrency evaluation using data science techniques such as data
                    collection, analysis, visualization, and feature engineering. Used Python, AWS, and SQL.
                    </li>
                <li>Led the crypto ledger analysis project, collaborating and communicating with members of other teams.</li>
                <li>Contributed to approximately 50% of the companyâ€™s minimum viable product that will allow them to launch
                    their business, as one of the first interns at this early-stage startup.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Collaborated with two other students to produce a 26-language compatible AI chatbot using Python, the
                    GPT-3 language model, and DeepL translator APIs, with over 88k tokens of user input sent to the model.
                    </li>
                <li>Researched a Japanese-specific BERT chatbot that would be more tailored for Japanese language learning.</li>
